# remote_ssh_tool
Apply commands to remote SSH servers
This is my first Python script written to actually accomplish something other than printing text to stdout. 
Hopefully this is the beginning of a long and interesting career in DevOps.

The program uses Fabric, which is a high level Python application which implements a couple other 
Python apps at a mid and lower level to accomplish the task of performing tasks remotly via SSH.

I am certain it is quite janky and junky. Heres to the future growth of my coding skills!
